      <description>Project OpenGuards, established in 2023 by the cybersecurity analyst Martin Kubeƒçka, focuses on the collection, processing, and analysis of data from the IP address space of Slovakia.
Data is gathered from various publicly available open sources, and then processed using our proprietary solution. In-depth analysis are conducted at three-month intervals, culminating in a comprehensive report that not only summarizes our findings but also offers valuable comparisons of data from different time periods.</description>
